# Sprint 1 Project: Bridging the Gender Gap Towards Financial Inclusion in the PH: A Data-Driven Approach
This project is created by team **4loop**. We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our first sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on financial inclusion entitled **Bridging the Gender Gap Towards Financial Inclusion in the PH: A Data-Driven Approach**. We visualized and analyzed the data for a research project aimed at explaining the gender gap in financial inclusion in the Philippines. The project uses data from the 2021 Global Findex database, which is wrangled and analyzed using Python Pandas, exploratory data analysis, and unsupervised machine learning.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project highlights the factors that contribute to the gender gap in the Philippines' financial inclusion. Through the exploratory data analysis and K-Modes clustering, we were able to discover that the main factors contributing to the gender gap are age, educational attainment, and household income group. Women who attained secondary education and those in the poorest income group are at the highest risk of being financially excluded.
