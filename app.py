        According to Debuque-Gonzales and Corpus (2021), the two basic dimensions of financial inclusion are Outreach and Usage. 

        Outreach refers to the supply-side data on the pervasiveness of formal financial accounts that include indicators on ownership of traditional financial accounts, fintech accounts, and credit cards. 

        Meanwhile, the usage dimension captures the extent of peopleâ€™s usage of their respective accounts. 

        Key Objecttives
        
        1. What segment of the population has  formal financial access?
        2. For those without formal financial access, what are the reasons for not owning a bank account?
